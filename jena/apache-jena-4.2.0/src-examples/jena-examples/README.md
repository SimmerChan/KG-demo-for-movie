A collection of complete, runnable Jena examples to illustrate various aspects of programming using RDF with Jena.

## Cheese ontology examples

Paolo Castagna is building a collection of RDF descriptions of the cheeses
of the world (see [Paolo's github account](https://github.com/castagna/cheese)
for the latest version). These examples use the cheese data, or its associated
ontology, as examples.

### Hello World

A very simple just-get-started example program that shows creating a memory
model, loading an RDF data file, and iterating over the model to select cheeses.


## Pizza ontology examples

The pizza ontology is widely used in ontology tutorials and classes. These
examples use that ontology as an illustration.

### Pizza SPARQL (no inference)

Using SPARQL to query the class expressions in the Pizza ontology without relying on
RDF inference.

## Streaming
