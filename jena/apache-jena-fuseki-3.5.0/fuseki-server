## Adding custom code to the Fuseki server:
##
## It is also possible to launch Fuseki using 
##   java $JVM_ARGS -cp "$JAR" org.apache.jena.fuseki.cmd.FusekiCmd "$@"
##
## "exec" is optional - it simply frees up an OS process.
## In this way, you can add custom java to the classpath:
## 
##   APPJAR=MyCode.jar
##   java $JVM_ARGS -cp "$JAR:$APPJAR" org.apache.jena.fuseki.cmd.FusekiCmd "$@"
